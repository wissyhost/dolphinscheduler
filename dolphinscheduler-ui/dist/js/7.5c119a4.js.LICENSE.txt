/**
 * jsBezier
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2010 - 2017 jsPlumb (hello@jsplumbtoolkit.com)
 *
 * licensed under the MIT license.
 *
 * a set of Bezier curve functions that deal with Beziers, used by jsPlumb, and perhaps useful for other people.  These functions work with Bezier
 * curves of arbitrary degree.
 *
 * - functions are all in the 'jsBezier' namespace.
 *
 * - all input points should be in the format {x:.., y:..}. all output points are in this format too.
 *
 * - all input curves should be in the format [ {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..}, {x:.., y:..} ]
 *
 * - 'location' as used as an input here refers to a decimal in the range 0-1 inclusive, which indicates a point some proportion along the length
 * of the curve.  location as output has the same format and meaning.
 *
 *
 * Function List:
 * --------------
 *
 * distanceFromCurve(point, curve)
 *
 * 	Calculates the distance that the given point lies from the given Bezier.  Note that it is computed relative to the center of the Bezier,
 * so if you have stroked the curve with a wide pen you may wish to take that into account!  The distance returned is relative to the values
 * of the curve and the point - it will most likely be pixels.
 *
 * gradientAtPoint(curve, location)
 *
 * 	Calculates the gradient to the curve at the given location, as a decimal between 0 and 1 inclusive.
 *
 * gradientAtPointAlongCurveFrom (curve, location)
 *
 *	Calculates the gradient at the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.
 *
 * nearestPointOnCurve(point, curve)
 *
 *	Calculates the nearest point to the given point on the given curve.  The return value of this is a JS object literal, containing both the
 *point's coordinates and also the 'location' of the point (see above), for example:  { point:{x:551,y:150}, location:0.263365 }.
 *
 * pointOnCurve(curve, location)
 *
 * 	Calculates the coordinates of the point on the given Bezier curve at the given location.
 *
 * pointAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)
 *
 * 	Calculates the coordinates of the point on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate
 * space as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.
 *
 * locationAlongCurveFrom(curve, location, distance)
 *
 * 	Calculates the location on the given curve that is 'distance' units from location.  'distance' should be in the same coordinate
 * space as that used to construct the Bezier curve.  For an HTML Canvas usage, for example, distance would be a measure of pixels.
 *
 * perpendicularToCurveAt(curve, location, length, distance)
 *
 * 	Calculates the perpendicular to the given curve at the given location.  length is the length of the line you wish for (it will be centered
 * on the point at 'location'). distance is optional, and allows you to specify a point along the path from the given location as the center of
 * the perpendicular returned.  The return value of this is an array of two points: [ {x:...,y:...}, {x:...,y:...} ].

// calculates and fills-in explicit stop positions when omitted from rule

// get a straight line.  this is also the case if the two anchors are within 'proximityLimit', since

// limits for, once again, aesthetic good sense in the layout of a chart using these connectors.

// points before the last delimiter, or `0` if there is none, then copy

// steer it around that node.  this will work within limits, but i think those limits would also be the likely
